It has been a while I didn&#8217;t change anything on the site.
  
For the past one month or so, I work on this on and off, locally, and finally now, finding the time to get the theme uploaded to the actual site.

You&#8217;ll still find plenty of rough edges, in fact rough edges is just an understatement, I think instead of waiting forever to get the redesign done, I will just upload it, and working on it at the side.

First thing you should notice is of course the use of font from typekit, it is lobster for the title, and Adelle for the rest.

So now I got to go back to work and improve it one small bit after another.
