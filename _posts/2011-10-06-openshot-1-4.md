I tried to get Openshot working again. There are suggestion that [locking libcairo2 at version 1.8](https://bugs.launchpad.net/openshot/+bug/580130/comments/17) would fix the problem, but select libcairo and Ctrl + E in Synaptic didn't give me option to choose and lock it at any particular version. Maybe I miss out some steps. So I figure maybe I should try uninstall and reinstall libcairo, big mistake. After the installation done, it just wouldn't let me go into the desktop environment.

Maybe there are ways to fix this without reinstalling Ubuntu, but since I will be having problem anyway with Openshot even I fix this issue, I just go for a clean installation instead.

I pull out the 11.04 installation disc put into the CDROM, and at about 2 hours later, I got Ubuntu back, sure enough, installing and running the spanking new Openshot 1.4 without a single problem.
