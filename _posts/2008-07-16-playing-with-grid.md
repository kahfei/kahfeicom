I have been reading

  * [Wilson Miner][1]&#8216;s the now legendary [Setting Type to the Web on a Baseline Grid][2]
  * [Jeff Croft][3]&#8216;s [Typography beyond font][4]
  * [Jason Beaird][5]&#8216;s [The Principle of Beautiful Typography][6]

All in the effort of improving the legibility and readability (ooh&#8230;using these terms alone make me thrilled, ha) of the site. Well, after some twist and tweak following Wilson&#8217;s tutorial, I would like to think that the minor changes did improve the site drastically, at least for me.
