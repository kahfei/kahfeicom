I have been reading

  * [Wilson Miner](http://www.wilsonminer.com/)&#8216;s the now legendary [Setting Type to the Web on a Baseline Grid](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/settingtypeontheweb)
  * [Jeff Croft](http://jeffcroft.com)&#8216;s [Typography beyond font](http://jeffcroft.com/blog/2007/dec/17/audio-available-my-webmaster-jam-session-talk/)
  * [Jason Beaird](http://www.jasongraphix.com/)&#8216;s [The Principle of Beautiful Typography](http://www.sitepoint.com/print/principles-beautiful-typography)

All in the effort of improving the legibility and readability (ooh&#8230;using these terms alone make me thrilled, ha) of the site. Well, after some twists and tweaks following Wilson&#8217;s tutorial, I would like to think that the minor changes did improve the site drastically, at least for me.
