ok, find some time to do a bit of minor changes on the site design.

Basically what I have in mind, is trying to use minimal graphics in the design and play mainly with CSS, different set of fonts(I don&#8217;t think I am qualified enough to say typography, so, no, I just playing with fonts), and minimal numbers of colors.

<div id="attachment_8" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
  <a href="http://www.kahfei.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/jontan.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-8" title="jontan" src="http://www.kahfei.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/jontan-300x273.jpg" alt="jontangerine" width="300" height="273" srcset="http://www.kahfei.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/jontan-300x273.jpg 300w, http://www.kahfei.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/jontan.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></dt> </dl> 
  
  <div class="mceTemp">
    <dl id="attachment_9" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 310px;">
      <dt class="wp-caption-dt">
        <a href="http://www.kahfei.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/subtraction.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-9" title="subtraction" src="http://www.kahfei.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/subtraction-300x278.jpg" alt="subtraction" width="300" height="278" srcset="http://www.kahfei.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/subtraction-300x278.jpg 300w, http://www.kahfei.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/subtraction.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>
        
        <p class="wp-caption-text">
          subtraction
        </p></div> 
        
        <dl id="attachment_8" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 310px;">
          <dd class="wp-caption-dd">
            jontangerine
          </dd>
        </dl></div>

          <a href="http://jontangerine.com/">jontangerine</a> and khoi vinh&#8217;s <a href="http://www.subtraction.com/">Subtraction</a> are two of the blogs that I frequent, and totally adore the design of their blog. As what people said, <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/article/copy-great-designers-steal">good designer copied, great designer steal</a>. I try to copy the concept of their blog&#8217;s layout, which I found so simple, yet so aestatically pleasing. I also try to make the site as much like a magazine layout as I can, you know, break out of the web2.0 look, if there is such a thing. I always think if my site is 20% as good as their, I will be more than happy.

          While I try to keep the colors used to minimal, I have been browsing around a few color schemes sites, those usual suspects like <a href="http://kuler.adobe.com/">kuler.adobe</a>, <a href="http://www.colourlovers.com/">colorlovers</a>, <a href="http://www.colorcombos.com/">colorcombos</a>, and settled on using mainly gray, black, white and a dash of orange. Hmmm&#8230;come to think of it, it is really not so unlike the colors scheme being used in jontangerine or Subtraction. Well, will have to try to twist and tweak it later on, to make a different.

          As for fonts, I read through jontangerine&#8217;s stylesheet, almost obsessively, looking for fonts type being used. There is something just so irresistible about those fonts type arrangement. But, at the same time, I have to refrain from just pressing ctrl + c and ctrl + v and copying over everything. Remember, I am just trying to learn from the best, not blindly copying. Ok, and so I experiments with a few different set of font types, and finally quite happy with Georgia for most of the content and the Blog title, Palatino Linotype for post title.

          So far, I am quite happy with the outcome. Next on will be adding in those standard stuff like blogrolls, comments, etc. Ah, and also, <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2008/07/wordpress-26-tyner/">WordPress 2.6</a> is out! Have just tested the upgrade on local, work right away. Will have to do that on this site as well.
