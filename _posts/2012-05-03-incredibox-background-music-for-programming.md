Found this [incredibox](http://www.incredibox.com/en/#/application) from [hacknernews](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3900711) few days ago, there is a neat interface lets you drag and drop different effects, melodies, beats and voices to create your own remixes. But the title in hackernews is saying "Background music for programming", which is a lie. The thing isÂ so fun to play around with, you immediately forgo your coding, and keep tinkering with incredibox
