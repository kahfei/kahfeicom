I have been blogging since 2003, but this is the very first time I have my own domain name. It almost felt like having your own house. But just as moving in to a new house, I don&#8217;t really have the luxury to sit down and spend all the time put up a design before start typing away. Just to have something other that the standard wordpress &#8220;Hello World&#8221; is tempting enough.

And so, the site design will be going on a live-designing process, which mean things might change day by day, or not change at all for a while (if I don&#8217;t really have the time or mood), ha. Anyhow, this is a place where I will be putting down my thought, mainly on webin general(like zillions of blogs out there&#8230;), some joomla (not unlike another zillions of blogs out there..), WordPress(while I working on this blog and venture into the world of WordPress), designs (now, I am not claiming design guru or anything, but just an enthusiast.)

And we will see as we go along.

So, here is my &#8220;Hello World&#8221;.
