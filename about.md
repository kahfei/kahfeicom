I have been blogging since 2005, but not once did I wrote an About page.
Reason aplenty, lack of time, don’t think it is a priority, and the fear of laying bare the ordinary me to whoever reading it.
But here I finally sat down and wrote one page about myself, not that I have some grandiose achievement already, rather an effort to come to term with who I am and live with it ;-)
 
Hi there, I am kahfei.
 
I work as a PDM Admin, SAP experts and Change Management Consultant. Quite a broad range of responsibilities at first glance, but at its core, all of them related to product data and processes derived to handle them, they are the pillar for a well-run organization.
 
I have a passion for creating things, thru writing, coding or sketching.
I think coding and writing are essentially the same thing, you are creating your own world with texts or codes, and there are great fun and satisfaction in creating your own world then seeing them come to life, making something out of nothing.
 
I write in Chinese and English. My Chinese is better than my English though, so I am working on improving the latter.
I code in ruby, ruby on rails for web stuff, picking up android development lately, Swift will be next. I like ruby a lot, I like the conciseness, flexibility, English-like syntax, lack of semi-colons, optional parenthesis, the sugarcoating, but I am undecided which camp I am on between language is just a means to an end, horses for courses and the language you used will defined you.
 
I used to sketch a lot. Though nowadays I still do some doodling on notepad’s margin during boring meetings, but hardly enough for my own liking (I mean the doodling, not the boring meetings) . Will start sketching again.
 
I read a lot. Haruki Murakami is my favorite author of all time, read almost all of his books. I also read books on technology, startup, entrepreneurship, self-improvement, etc.
I listen to a lot of podcasts, DormRoomTycoons, TimFerriss, hardcore History, Love your work, Startup Podcast, 5x5 are some of my favorites.
 
I am a husband, son, and father for two kids. I used to work as a barista many years ago.
